## Motivation
Data Analysis of a set that epitomises truth one of wine
## File Description
- **wqw.csv**, white wine data set
- **album_vino_vertias.pdb**, PowerBI analysis save aas PDB file
## Results
I found that features of white wine like alcohol and density(related to how smooth the wine is), while other features like residual acidity and sugar have a more skewed distibution to higher quality.
Meaning more moderately high quality wines are more balance in terms of features, and poor and high quality wines share a more obscure balance of features.
